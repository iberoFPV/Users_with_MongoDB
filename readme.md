## Quick Start

Initiating this thrilling technological odyssey is as simple as running the "nodeapi.js" command. This will deploy the development server. Then, with the grace of a digital navigator, simply navigate to http://localhost:3000/ in your web browser. There you have it: you'll receive the HTML file directly from the server, immersing yourself in the elegance of our application.
